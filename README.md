**Stone-Paper-Scissors Game (200-word Description):**

Stone-Paper-Scissors is a simple and popular hand game often used to make a decision between two people. It involves three possible hand gestures: a closed fist for stone (or rock), an open hand for paper, and a fist with the index and middle fingers extended for scissors. The rules are straightforward: stone crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper covers stone. If both players choose the same gesture, the round is a draw.

This game is commonly played in a best-of-three format and is widely recognized across many cultures due to its simplicity, fairness, and quick resolution. It requires no tools, no setup, and no age limit, making it accessible to everyone. Despite being based on chance, players sometimes try to predict their opponentâ€™s next move using patterns or psychology, adding a layer of informal strategy.

Stone-Paper-Scissors is also used in decision-making scenarios like choosing teams or settling minor disputes, often taking the place of a coin toss. In modern times, it has also inspired digital versions and even tournaments. The game remains a timeless classic due to its balance of luck, spontaneity, and playful competition.
